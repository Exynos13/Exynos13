## Hey welcome to my GitHub!

A graduate in Master's of Data Science with a passion to leverage data to uncover impactful insights using data. Most exciting part of working with data is building a story based on patterns relationships which aren't immediately obvious. I am eager to bring in my analytical and problem solving skills in an professional Environment. 

My Latest work experience was with AMWTech:
-	Spearheaded the development and deployment of a web app using Python Flask and Heroku, leveraging a RoBERTa-based transformer model for audience generation, enhancing targeted marketing strategies for advertisers with data-driven insights.
-	Extracted and analyzed live data from Social Media APIs (X, Reddit, YouTube) focusing on user-entered keywords and ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines. This met the client's requirement for responsible data collection, successfully acquiring data from all targeted platforms. 
-	Developed a -Python script to build a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for the built NLP (Natural language processing) model, automating the data preprocessing from the various different sources and enabling seamless transition between NLP models if needed. This pipeline enhanced data consistency and reliability, reducing preprocessing time by 20% and increased the overall project efficiency.
-	Optimized data storage and retrieval by designing and managing SQL databases, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets for model predictions.


In addition, I have 3 years of experience as a Solution Manager consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. 

Skilled in Python,R, Java, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, C++, SolMan, and C and have a strong background in consulting
